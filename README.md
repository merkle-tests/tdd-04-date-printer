# Goal
Be able to test printCurrentDate function without changing the method signature.

1. Test the code with doubles created by you.
2. Test the code with doubles from a library.

# Code to test
```java
public static class DatePrinter {
    public void printCurrentDate() {
		System.out.println(new Date());
	}
}
```
